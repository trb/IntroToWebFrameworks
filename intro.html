          Web apps are build on three technologies - html, the DOM, and
          javascript. There's a lot of overlap between the three, and they're
          all connected, but they represent different concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Html is a mark-up language that looks a little bit like XML, but is
          not compatible with XML (at least Html5 is not.) Html is used to
          define things as buttons, or headlines, or just normal text, and to
          split the viewport of the browser into different sections. Here's an
          example:
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/trb/ed128e4349a12986d0c6e3ea0b159330.js"></script>
        <p>
          And it looks like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <span>Is this a cool website?</span>
              <button onclick="alert('hooray')">Yes</button>
            </div>
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a fixed list of tags or nodes that Html supports, for
          example <code>a, ul or table</code> for links
          (<strong>a</strong>nchor), lists (<strong>u</strong>nsorted <strong>l</strong>ist), and tables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some tags can be nested in others, and some can accept specific
          attributes. In this example we use the <code>onclick</code> attribute
          to make the button react to clicks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which takes us to the next topic - Javascript.
          <code>alert('hooray')</code>
          is a simple Javascript function that
          tells the browser to create a popup window. It accepts a simple
          string parameter and uses it for the content of the popup.
        </p>
        <p>
          This example creates a very simple interaction, just a button that
          creates a pop up. If there was any business logic included, e.g.
          embedding a form in a popup and checking that it's values are valid,
          then obviously the above approach does not work out. We can't embed
          business logic in our view templates!
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter the DOM, the document object model. The browser parses out the
          Html document, and makes it modifiable via Javascript through the
          DOM api.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's change the example html a little bit:
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/trb/f9e145e3ab0b74c60b8cdad16a387f35.js"></script>
        <p>
          Very similar, but we've removed the inline
          <code>onclick="alert('hooray')"</code> attribute and instead added an
          <code>id</code> attribute. This will allow us to access the button
          via the DOM from Javascript:
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/trb/98f21e33c281aa5c2fda2fa181f5655d.js"></script>
        <p>
          So now we use the DOM to access the button-tag and manage our
          interaction from our code, our view template is now clean and simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here should be an example of how to create and modify DOM nodes. Then
          move on to make the DOM completely generated via Javascript. Create
          some functions that add DOM nodes to other DOM nodes. Show how these
          relate to React components. Show how managing state quickly becomes
          an issue, and how various frameworks solve this - react redux,
          react with useReducer and context, svelte, angular.
